### Roadmap to the Directories

##### lang
`lang` is a simple test language written with a tutorial in python.

##### legOS
`legOS` is an two variants of the same simple, barebones operating system. One is written for an ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, the other is written for a RISC-V CPU.

##### lift_asmprog
`lift_asmprog` is a symbolic executor for some simple assembly programs to verify correctness. In the future, this will expand to contain symbolic reasoning for the simple operating system `legOS`.

##### preq
`preq` contains some simple `z3` examples in Python for basic understanding.

##### qemu
`qemu` is a program to emulate microcontrollers

##### rkt_work
`rkt_work` contains a bunch of test Racket programs and some simple symbolic executors in Rosette that give a feel for how instructions are interpreted.

##### sign
`sign` is a simple sign checking program in C, which complies to both ARM and RISC-V assembly code. It  checks the sign of an integer.

##### serval-sosp19
`serval-sosp19` contains the code for the `serval` library.

##### serval-tutorial-sosp19
`serval-tutorial-sosp19` contains a sample toy monitor that is verified with `serval`.

##### software-foundations
`software-foundations` is a book about using the `Coq` language to reasona about algorithms and data structures, etc.

##### unitary
`unitary` is a draft of single core `notary`

##### xv6-public
`xv6` is a simple operating system written for `x86` CPUs.

##### xv6-riscv-fall19
`xv6` is a simple operating system written for `riscv64` CPUs.

##### z3-proofs
`z3-proofs` contains some simple z3 proofs for learning purposes.
